# STARBUCKS

This is a landing page with a image slider and color changes, inspired in [This Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91Q6RvKvd7o) on Youtube.

## Overview

My ideia was to reproduce the HTML and CSS design and practice my Javascript skills, creating a main.js file and refactoring the code, instead of using a script tag in HTML.

Besides the image sider, i added the color changes of the word 'starbucks'.
